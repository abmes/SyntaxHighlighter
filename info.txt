In your scenario, the best thing for you to do would be to create a TagAggregator (see IViewTagAggregatorFactoryService) for IClassificationTags. Creating the tagger will force the classifiers to be created immediately and you can use ITagAggregator<IClassificationTags>.GetTags() to get the classifications on the text you are interested in.
